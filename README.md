# Barkitect
AI-powed game: A virtual buddy you can talk to, train, and grow with — just like in real life. It was made for the Supercell AI Hackathon in May 2025.

# 💡 Inspiration
This project started with a simple question: What if we could recreate the emotional bond of pet ownership, but accessible to everyone, anytime, anywhere?
Barkitect is for those who want a friend to talk to, train, and care for — even if they can’t have one in real life.

# 🐾 What is Barkitect?
Barkitect is an AI-powered virtual pet training experience built with Unreal Engine 5. The name combines “bark” and “architect,” reflecting your role as the architect of your dog’s emotions and behavior. Players interact with a realistic 3D dog using natural voice commands. The system leverages speech recognition and OpenAI to interpret what the player says and translate it into clear, simple actions the dog can perform. Our long-term vision for AI, the dog doesn't just perform actions — it learns, responds, and builds habits through repeated voice interactions, forming conditioned reflexes just like a real dog. Imagine a virtual companion that not only obeys but understands, comforts, and grows with you.

# 🎯 What problem does it solve?
Not everyone can own a real dog — due to allergies, cost, housing restrictions, or life circumstances. Yet many people still crave the connection, responsibility, and emotional boost that comes with having a loyal companion. Barkitect brings the joy of training, bonding, and playing with a dog into the digital world — using AI to make it feel real.

# 🛠️ What have we built so far?

- Unreal Engine 5 environment with animated dog asset
- Basic voice recognition model integrated
- OpenAI query system that turns spoken input into structured commands
- Prototype phase of dog responding to commands (in progress)
# 🌱 What’s next?
- Memory-based training model: The dog learns from past sessions, rewards, and punishments, just like real-world pet training
- Emotional detection from voice: Understand if you're happy, sad, or angry — and react with appropriate behavior
- Multiplayer support: Walk your dog, meet other players, and participate in training competitions
- Expansion to other pets: Cats, hamsters, and more in future versions
- Mental wellness support: Designed to help reduce loneliness and bring joy to people through AI companions
Immersive virtual reality integration: Experience a deeper bond by physically petting, playing, or even cuddling your dog in virtual space, bridging the gap between digital and emotional connection.
# ⚙️ Technical Roadmap
- Client-server upgrade: Move from basic Python scripts to a real-time server-client setup.
- Deeper AI: Go beyond commands — understand intent, emotion, and context.
- Smarter animations: Expand from simple actions to emotional, lifelike behaviors in UE5.
- Memory & learning: Dog remembers past interactions, adapting over time.
